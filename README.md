# BigMLWallOfSubs
Automating the wall of subs for BigML

If you clone this to your local environment and start and http server in the root directory, "wall.html" will be what your viewers will see eventually, but I learned it needs to be renamed to index.html to be served from github.

Its still really early so the bot blank. I have some code started, but not pushed.
